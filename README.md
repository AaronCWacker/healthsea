## Creating better access to health ðŸ’‰
The goal is to analyze user-generated reviews of supplements and extract their effects on health. We want to create product recommendations for specific health conditions based on what customers wrote in their reviews.
The usage of complementary medicine is an excellent alternative to conventional medicine when it comes to maintaining health. Due to its rising popularity, consumers have access to a wide variety of products. However, it's likely that most of them are redundant and produced in a "quantity over quality" fashion to maximize profit. This white noise of products makes it hard for customers to find valuable supplements. Additionally, supplement manufacturers are not allowed to claim health benefits for their products if not scientifically approved, increasing manual work for customers.
