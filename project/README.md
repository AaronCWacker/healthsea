# ü™ê spaCy Project: Healthsea

This project trains a Named-Entity-Recognition model, a Text Classification model, and assembles them together with custom components into a finished end-to-end pipeline.

## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `requirements` | Install dependencies and requirements |
| `parse_ner` | Load the annotations to Prodigy and use data-to-spacy to split the data into a training and development set |
| `parse_textcat` | Parse the textcat annotation file manually into a training and development set |
| `train_ner` | Train a Named-Entity-Recognition model |
| `evaluate_ner` | Evaluate a trained Named-Entity-Recognition model |
| `train_textcat` | Train a Text Classification model |
| `evaluate_textcat` | Evaluate a trained Text Classification model |
| `assemble_healthsea` | Assemble trained components into the healthsea pipeline |
| `evaluate_healthsea` | Evaluate the finished healthsea pipeline |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `install` | `requirements` |
| `parse` | `parse_ner` &rarr; `parse_textcat` |
| `train` | `train_ner` &rarr; `train_textcat` |
| `evaluate` | `evaluate_ner` &rarr; `evaluate_textcat` |
| `assemble` | `assemble_healthsea` &rarr; `evaluate_healthsea` |

### üóÇ Assets

The following assets are defined by the project. They can
be fetched by running [`spacy project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-assets)
in the project directory.
